The National Air Quality Index Standard (NAQI) in India was launched by The Minister for Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, on 17 September 2014. The initiative constitutes part of the Government’s mission to introduce the “culture of cleanliness”, as the air pollution has been a huge concern in the country, especially in urban areas. The National Air Monitoring Program (NAMP), that covers 240 cities in the country, has been operated by the  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and developed by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT), providing data in public domain, on real time basis.

To understand how the AQI works, you just have to know the six range categories (Good, Satisfactory, Moderately Polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe) and check the associated health impacts. Solutions should be taken based on the AQI Category and the pollutant associated to it, as follows:

AQI categories and breakpoint concentrations with averaging times

(units: µg/m3 unless mentioned otherwise)

If you check the Indian NAQI, you are gonna realize that the Particulate Matter (PM) pollution ranks is the worst among the other pollutants. Compared to the other countries, ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in Delhi rank among the highest levels measured in any city in the world: about 15 times higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline concentrations. This means that several interventions to change this scenario must be taken by the government and the local population, otherwise we’re gonna still be facing a lot of health and environmental implications due to air pollution. Seems like building awareness is the best way to start.
